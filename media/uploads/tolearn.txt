Backend Development Path
Django (Deep Expertise)

Learn: Django ORM, Middleware, Signals, Forms, Authentication, and Admin Customization.
Projects: Build a RESTful API, an e-commerce backend, or a blog platform with user management.
Database Management (Moderate)

SQL: Master complex queries, indexing, and optimization.
Tools: MySQL, SQLite, and PostgreSQL.
Projects: Design normalized databases for real-world projects (e.g., for an e-commerce site).
RESTful APIs (Advanced)

Learn: Django REST Framework, API versioning, authentication, and testing.
Projects: Create a multi-tiered API for a task management app or a weather dashboard.
Authentication & Security (Advanced)

Learn: OAuth, JWT, rate limiting, and protection against common vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and CSRF.
Depth: Understand best practices for secure application development.
Testing (Basic to Moderate)

Tools: Pytest, Django’s built-in testing framework.
Projects: Write unit tests and integration tests for your Django apps.
Containerization and Deployment (Basic)

https://docker-curriculum.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#docker-compose LINK
Tools: Docker (creating Dockerfiles, managing containers).
Projects: Containerize a Django app and deploy it using Docker Compose.
Advanced Python Concepts (Moderate)

Learn: Asynchronous programming (asyncio, FastAPI for advanced projects), multi-threading, and multi-processing.
Cloud Engineering Path
AWS Core Services (Deep Expertise)

Focus: EC2, S3, RDS, IAM, and CloudWatch.
Depth: Learn provisioning, configuration, and monitoring.
Projects: Build a scalable web app deployed on EC2 and integrate with S3 for file storage.
Infrastructure as Code (Moderate)

Tools: Terraform or AWS CloudFormation.
Projects: Automate the setup of a simple web app infrastructure using IaC tools.
Containerization (Advanced)

Learn: Docker (in-depth), orchestration with Kubernetes (basic to moderate).
Projects: Deploy a microservices architecture on a containerized infrastructure.
Serverless Frameworks (Moderate)

Tools: AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB.
Projects: Create a serverless API for a lightweight service like a URL shortener.
Networking (Basic)

Learn: VPCs, Load Balancers, Auto-scaling Groups, Route53.
Depth: Set up and secure networks for applications.
CI/CD Pipelines (Moderate)

Tools: AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins, or GitHub Actions.
Projects: Implement CI/CD for a Django project with auto-deployment on AWS.
Monitoring & Logging (Basic)

Tools: AWS CloudWatch, ELK Stack.
Projects: Monitor a live application’s performance and set alerts for critical events.
